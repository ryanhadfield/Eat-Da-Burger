# Wasatch-Burgers

## Description

Wasatch Burgers is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. The app allows the user to use a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The app follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

This app is deployed on [Heroku](https://wasatch-burgers.herokuapp.com/).
